# javaMiniproject
This repository contains files and code of our java mini project which is  about Airline reservation system.

This software was build to provide assistance for the purpose of reserving tickets, or cancelling a reserved ticket, as well as rescheduling tickets. Since the information will be centralised so it can be easily updated in case of any changes to flight schedule. This minimises the need of help lines and customer support even at any locations. Thus it can help in minimizing the need for manual work.

This system has been developed to help passengers in reserving their tickets online, access information about reserved passengers and passengers on waiting, cancel a booked ticket, and even reschedule a ticket. The main disadvantage of a manual system is eradicated in this software, i.e. the introduction of an error due to manual negligence.

Existing System
Manual systems are more prone to error. Hence many a times they are unreliable. In cases of any changes in the flight schedule or cancellation of any flight, if the changes are not reciprocated to the passengers on time it causes a lot of inconvenience and this affects the reliability of the airlines as well. Any discrepancy may cause a lot of chaos and trouble to the airlines as well as passengers.

Proposed System
The airways reservation system provides passengers with an online means of booking a flight ticket as well as cancellation of a previously booked ticket. A passenger can also reschedule a ticket as per convenience and look up if there are seats available in the questioned flight or not. The passengers can stay updated with the flight information. This provides a lot of ease to the passengers as well as the airlines.

Modules
Booking module:– This has two sub modules namely: Reservation and Cancellation.
Reservation: This modules lets a passenger to create a new passenger profile and book a ticket on an available flight.
Cancellation: This module allows the user to cancel a previously booked ticket.
Reports module:– This module has two sub-modules:
Confirmed Passenger List: This is a list of all the passengers, whose tickets are confirmed, i.e., the ticket has been successfully booked.
Waiting List: This is the list of the passengers whose tickets are yet to be confirmed for booking.

Steps:
1) Install netbeans
2) For database , Install XAMPP server
After done this follow the step that is given below:

Step:

1)open the netbeans.
2)create a new project.
3) Copy all the file that is given in netbeans folder.
4)after copy right click on the source packages and paste here.
5)now we are add the jar folder, so right click on libraries and select Add jar/folder then go to the that place where you store the downloaded file and select the add jar folder then open and  add the file ony by one.

 Now we are create a database folder.
Step:
1) Open XAMPP server .
2)Then click admin in mysql line.
3) afte that click on new.
4)Give the database folder name that is given in netbean folder.
5)after that go to the netbeans project and right click on signup file .
7)i am already created that table name so i can not create same table name but i give u example how to create a table name so you can create a new table and give column name.
9) save the FILE 
10)u will create all the table name that is given in the folder
11) u do not need to create a customer table.
